    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a recipe I came up with myself. It is great with most Italian
      dishes. It can be doubled as needed.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, halved lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix butter, garlic salt, rosemary, basil, thyme, garlic
        powder and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread each half of the French bread with equal portions of the butter
        mixture. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bread halves, crusts down, on a medium baking sheet. Bake in the
        preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are very lightly
        browned.
      </li>
    </ol>
