    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Simple meatballs with an unusual chili sauce/grape jelly coating. Quite a
      combination of tastes and textures. Note: After cooking, I like to keep
      the meatballs warm in a slow cooker until ready to serve.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

      <li>½ cup dried bread crumbs</li>

      <li>⅓ cup chopped onion</li>

      <li>¼ cup milk</li>

      <li>1 egg</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

      <li>¼ cup shortening</li>

      <li>12 fluid ounces tomato-based chili sauce</li>

      <li>1 ¼ cups grape jelly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, milk, egg,
        salt, Worcestershire sauce, and ground black pepper. Mix together, and
        shape into meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat shortening over medium heat. Add meatballs, and
        cook until browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from skillet, and drain
        on paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chili sauce and jelly to skillet; heat, stirring, until jelly is
        melted. Return meatballs to skillet, and stir until coated. Reduce heat
        to low. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
